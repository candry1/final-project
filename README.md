## What does your application do?
Our application is a vacation planner, where you can provide your budget, destination, how many people you're traveling with, travel dates, and some tags for things your group would be interested in. Our web app will then provide activities and lodging options, all within your budget and travel dates.

## What makes it different than a CRUD app? I.e., what functionality does it provide that is not just a user interface layer on top of a database of user information,and the ability to view / add to / change that information?
Our web app will take into account your budget, calculating what you can afford with your group, using real-time pricings of everything. If your budget isn't quite feasible with your group size and/or destination, the target will be more free activities, and conservative lodging. Taking into account preference of activities and travel dates will allow us to make this experience more personal to the user.

## What security and privacy concerns do you expect you (as developers) or your users to have with this application?
With this, whatever the users decide to book, we want that to be completely private(location, dates of travel, where they'll stay). If they need to pay directly with us, card information needs to be kept private. Prices we get, we want them to be verified, to prevent overpaying unnecessarily or through the interference of someone else.
